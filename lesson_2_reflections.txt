What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git folder is created. The files in the folder are needed for configuring the git settings for that repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is more temporary and allows flexibility in changing the contents, while the working directory and repository are more permanent.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can use the staging area to review the specific files that need the logical change and only include those.
