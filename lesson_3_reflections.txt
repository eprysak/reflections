When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote repository if I were to work on my code from a different computer or if I didn't have access to my local computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling manually gives you more control over when you should pull all of the changes made. Sometimes you are working with a group where multiple people are making changes, and it can get messy if too many changes are being made at once.
Pulling manually helps you control the changes that you want in your local repository.
